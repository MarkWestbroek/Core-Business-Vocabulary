# Core Business Vocabulary

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the Core Business Vocabulary.

The Core Business Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a legal entity. The vocabulary is closely integrated with the Person and Location Core Vocabularies.

The current version of the Core Business Vocabulary is [2.1.0](https://semiceu.github.io/Core-Business-Vocabulary/releases/2.1.0/).
The latest editor draft of the Core Business Vocabulary is [2.2.0](https://semiceu.github.io/Core-Business-Vocabulary/releases/2.2.0/).

This specification was produced by the Core Vocabularies Working Group (Business Task Force), following the Process and Methodology for Developing Core Vocabularies, https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/document/process-and-methodology-developing-core-vocabularies. It has been reviewed by representatives of the Member States of the European Union, PSI publishers, and by other interested parties. Publication of this Final Draft does not imply endorsement by the European Commission or its representatives. On 23 May 2012, the Member State representatives in the ISA Coordination Group have endorsed the Core Business vocabulary v1.00, acknowledging the work and promising to further disseminate it at national level.
